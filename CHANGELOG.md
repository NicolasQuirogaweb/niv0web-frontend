# Changelog

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). This file starts with the September 2026 cleanup; earlier history is in `git log`.

## [Unreleased]

Requires the backend from the same date (`/samplepacks` in lowercase, `itemsCount`, `?type=` on playlists, `beatPlaylists` on the dashboard).

### Fixed
- Editing a sample pack opened an empty form.
- The playlist page always fetched beats, so loop catalogs didn't open.
- `/beats` also listed loop catalogs.
- Dashboard: the "loop catalogs" card showed the number of loops.
- Home: logged-in users saw "log in". Loops had no link anywhere.

### Added
- `/loops` lists loop catalogs, the same way `/beats` does.
- A visible error when a download fails.
- Accessibility: keyboard seek bar, a real dialog for confirmations, `<html lang>` synced with the language.
- Tests: playlist page by type, sample pack edit, dashboard.

### Changed
- The admin panel loads on demand (lazy routes).
- Shared `PageHeader` and `TrackList` instead of blocks copied between pages.
- Node 22 in CI.

### Removed
- About 24 MB of images and videos that nothing referenced.
- Service worker registration: `service-worker.js` never existed.
- Source maps in production.
